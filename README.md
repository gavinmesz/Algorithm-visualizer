# Algorithm-visualizer: Gavin Mesz
A small game exploring and visualizing 2 common O(n^2) sorting algorithms. Bubble sort and Selection sort. This was made as my final project for my grade 12 computer science course.

Below is the selection menu where you can move a white square character around and choose how many values are inside the sorting vasualization.

Below is the interactive screen where blocks move and change colour based on the algorithm chosen. In bubble sort, the blocks change green if they are in the correct place, they change red if they were swapped with a larger value. In selection sort, the blocks change green if they are in the correct place and change red if being selected to change positions with the largest value in the array.
